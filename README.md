# Cinema_Management_UOW

This Java-based application leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage airplane seating and ticketing. It allows users to perform various operations such as purchasing tickets, canceling seats, searching for tickets, and displaying seating plans.

Key Features:
Seat Purchase: Users can buy tickets by providing personal information (name, surname, email). The application verifies seat availability, calculates ticket prices based on seat location, and stores ticket details.
Seat Cancellation: Allows users to cancel previously booked seats. The application updates the seating plan and deletes the associated ticket file.
First Available Seat: Quickly finds and displays the first available seat in the plane.
Seating Plan Display: Shows the current seating arrangement, indicating occupied and available seats.
Ticket Information and Total Sales: Prints detailed ticket information along with the total sales amount.
Ticket Search: Users can search for tickets using seat number and row, and view the associated booking details.
